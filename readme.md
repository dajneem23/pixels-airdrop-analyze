# Requirements
Analyze, research & create a report for Pixels airdrop
1. Track token retention rate (what % of airdopped tokens were sold) - it is very important that you do not consider every token transferred as sold. Some tokens may be staked or added to liquidity pools.
2. Segment claimers into cohorts based on various characteristics.
3. What could Pixels team have done differently to achieve a better airdrop performance? Support your arguments with data.

We realize it wouldn't be possible to pull the claimant data in the given timeframe but we expect you to analyze at least 750 wallets that claimed tokens from the airdrop.
